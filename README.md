# Euler-Special-Pythagorean-triplet
There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find the product abc.

# About The Project

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. https://projecteuler.net/problem=9

This is the nineth problem in the series. 

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

a2 + b2 = c2
For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.

# Built with:

The solution was built with Javascript ES6. Javascript concepts used:

nested for loop, if statement, Math method

<!-- # What I learned:

Two approches to solve the problem in the first file. The firt with the linear and second with the quadratic notation. Noticed the second ran faster than the first which is 
not usuall for these, maybe because the second loop had considerably less loops to go through or maybe because the algorithm had to find only one y[i] index and continued from
there while the first had to find all the y[i + number] from the start. Explore linked list later

Working on third approach....

I am learning better how some of these string and array methods work.

Explored the use of console.time()/console.timeEnd() to measure how fast a program runs.

Exploring time complexities with the O(N) and O(N2)

Applied the sliding window problem solving pattern to solve the problem
